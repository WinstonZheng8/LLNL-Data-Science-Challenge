# LLNL-Data-Science-Challenge

Developed a data-driven approach to reconstruct electroanatomical maps of the heart using neural networks. 
Applied binary classification, abnormal heartbeat categorization, and 1D convolution neural network application for time series data transformation.
Constructed a standard 12-lead ECG data combined with random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression  to identify normal and abnormal heartbeat. 
Explored open-ended challenges, including reconstructing complete spatio-temporal activation maps of the human heart.
